This is a somewhat rudimentary, vaguely tested editor for nokteholda's ice highway map (https://nokteholda.github.io/WorldMC-Ice-Highways-Map/).

In addition to tools to edit the lines and stations, it also features a preview map to see what you are doing, and to edit the path of the lines.

Controls:
(When editing the path of a line)
- Left click to select, or hold to pan view.
- Right click to add a corner
- Delete to remove a selected corner

Selected corners are highlighted in red, unselected corners are blue.
